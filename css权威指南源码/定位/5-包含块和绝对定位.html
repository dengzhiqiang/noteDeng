<p>
    This paragraph does <em>not</em> establish a containing block for any of its
    descendant elements that are absolutely positioned. Therefore, the absolutely
    positioned <b>boldface </b> element it contains will be positioned with
    respect to the initial containing block.
</p>
<p class="contain">
    Thanks to 'position: relative', this paragraph establishes a containing
    block for any of its descendant elements that are absolutely positioned.
    Since there is such an element-- <em>that is to say, <b>a boldfaced element
    that is absolutely positioned,</b> placed with respect to its containing
    block (the paragraph)</em>, it will appear within the element box generated
    by the paragraph.
